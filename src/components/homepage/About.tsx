            <p className="text-sm mt-1 leading-6">I'm an aspiring software developer with a passion for building responsive, accessible,
                and user-friendly web interfaces. I love working with modern design principles, focusing on performance, and making
                sure every user has a smooth experience. I'm experienced in creating interactive features, making sure websites look
                great on any device, and following best practices in UI/UX design.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm mt-3 leading-6">
                Lately, I've been working on leveling up my skills even more â€” diving deeper into both front-end and back-end technologies
                to create more full-fledged, complete applications. I'm excited about building projects from the ground up and bringing
                ideas to life through clean code and thoughtful design.
